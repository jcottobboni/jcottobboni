### Hi, I'm JoÃ£o Carlos Ottobboni ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer specializing in Ruby on Rails. I make things from scratch, contribute to open source, and write about development in an accessible and intuitive way.

-  Iâ€™m currently working on Siedos.
-  Iâ€™m currently learning about Ansible and DevOps
-  Ask me about Ruby on Rails development and Ansible.
-  How to reach me: jcottobboni@gmail.com
-  Fun fact: I love to study and learn more about medieval culture. I also like to build things, currently trying to be a blacksmith apprentice.
